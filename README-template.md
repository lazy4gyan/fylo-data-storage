## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I have used flexbox and bem to complete this and also learned how to customize range input. But still feels like that I can do better than this which I will try to improve so that I can make a good project.

### Continued development

Now, I want to focus on flex,grid and webkit to make sites more responsive.
